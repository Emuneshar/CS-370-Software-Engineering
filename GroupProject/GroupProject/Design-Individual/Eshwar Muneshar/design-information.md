Firstly I have set up a couple of UML Classes, which I will list below. We have the:

- Reminder Class
- List Of Reminders
- Reminder Data Base
- Application Gui/User

In the Reminder class I have that this class should be able to Add, Delete and Edit Reminders. From this class the user should also be able to check off Individual reminders. This class should also be able to save the current state of the reminder as the user creates/modifies it. This is denoted as "Save current state", so the current state is saved automatically. 

Next is the List of Remiders class. This class has Reminder Type, Date and time of the reminder, and the list type as attributes. Funtions of this class are check off the entire list, edit the entire list, or delete the entire list. in addition to this the user can create a new list. 

The reminder database is up next and the database should be pretty straightforward. The Database should be able to store reminders, list of reminders, and the data associated with reminders, such as reminder name, addresses, etc. 

Lastly we have the User Interface or the GUI. From the user interface the system should be able to Display reminders, Select the time frame or user for which reminders needs to be shown, and set reminders based off of time or location. The interface should be able to display reminders based on type and time frame. The user should be able to search for reminders or lists of reminders, create new reminders and new lists of reminders, and clear out checked off remidners.
