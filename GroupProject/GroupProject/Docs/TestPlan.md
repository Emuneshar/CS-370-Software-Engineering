\# Test Plan

**Author**: <Team 1>

**## 1 Testing Strategy**

We will start with Unit testing then Integration Test. If the build is correct then we will move forward to System,Regression and API testing in order.

**### 1.1 Overall strategy**

**Unit Testing** Test the individual components of the software.

*1. Create Reminder-- Check that the new reminder is added.*

*2. Rename-- check if the user is able to re-write.*

*3. Delete-- User is able to delete from the list.*

*4. Search-- Find the reminder from the list.*

**Integration testing** will be performed by the QA tester to ensure multiple modules of the application perform together smoothly.

- Newly created reminder is able to select different types of event, able to add location,able delete,remove and Edit.

**System testing**  will be performed by running the application on an android device to ensure the application as a  whole performs according to the userâ€™s requirement.

**Regression testing** will be performed if needed by developers to ensure new code does not have a negative impact on the existing code.

1. *Database should be configured as per the application requirements.*
1. *Return the value regards to its input.*
1. *Update the database.*
1. *Push the update to the database*

**### 1.2 Test Selection**

- We will test using black & white box techniques.

- White-box testing will be used on units, going through the code to see if each unit works as intended.

- Black-box testing will be used on the system and regression, including if the program executes or not, choosing valid and invalid inputs to check if the program works correctly, see if the selected function shows the expected output, etc.

- Most testing will be done manually

**### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion**

- To ensure a list of good quality test cases, we will select cases that cover every function of the application, i.e. every structure must execute at least once.

**### 1.4 Bug Tracking**

Will be tracked using github version tracking.

Bug testing will be dealt by the QA tester

We will use LogCat and Runtime Stack provided by Android Studio 

**### 1.5 Technology**

**JUNIT --** Well suited for Manual Testing. 

**Android Studio --** proved real time feedback on the app progress

**Java** -- will be used for programming the app.

**MySql** -- needed for the database of the app.
