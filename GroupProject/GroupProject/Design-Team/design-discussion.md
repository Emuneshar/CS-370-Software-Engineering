**Section 1: (Individual Design)**

**Cons:** It can be stressful and hard to delete and update anything from the UML for its dense dependency to one another.







**Design 2: (Sital Pun)**

**Pros**: Its readable and easy to visualize relationship between classes

**Cons**: There are too many operations going on so it's kind of confusing and might take a lot of time to manage while working on the actual designing process.![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EFvEDxpmfBDMslkdj9AHxyJL0usOxBI2qaVr_XdfSVHMxsvHB3RDLXZ32tw4Rl6vFcH_0WGwGCNJWFdHgf0OHASQDYkPvfWNaY2krE0td7-N4RlTRcSfSAll1TikCzKfsg=s1600)









**Design 3: (Eshwar Muneshar)**

**Pros:** It is a very general guideline for what the software design should be. It leaves a lot up to interpretation and leaves room for many things to be interpreted in different ways.

**Cons:** It is a very simplistic design and may not have all the needed details to be successfully implemented.

**Design 4: (Sakibur Karim)**

**Pros**: Database of Reminders can update anytime there's a change

**Cons**: Reminder may not accurately save map location

**Design 5:** 

**PROS**: The design provides in detail structure for the Reminder Project. In the UML it demonstrates the database implementation(CRUD) and the getRemainder method to retrieve data.In addition, it provides the different classes to illustrate the Object-Oriented Design Approach. The class contains the necessary methods to develop the application as per product owner’s requirement.

**CONS:** The Diagram fails to show the proper relationship among the class objects.The MAP API does not state which API to use. The design also fails to demonstrate the order of development process, that may escalate confusion.

While all of our individual designs got the job done effectively, Akram’s design was more in depth and well put together. Each of our individual designs had the crucial components to get the job done, but we chose this design because while it not only got the job done, it also included the Maps API and the implementation of a number of operations that could be useful to the end user.

**Section 3: (Summary)**

*We learned that all “Reminder” functions must be included in order for the design to work as intended.*

*We learned that the DB or the Database of Reminders acts as the “central processing unit” and plays a significant role in the UML design.*
